    body: 'Tyler and Felix Homes were wonderful. I sold the house almost immediately for more money than I was asking. And since I saved almost $14,000 on the commission, I was happy. Tyler was easy to deal with, very understandable, knowledgeable, and professional. He always picked up the phone when I called him, and he answered my emails and texts right away.',

    body: "We listed our house in Antioch with felix as I was very much against paying a commission that would give an agent the kind of check that would take equity that I spent years working for. I mean really... It's Nashville! One of many cities where an agent who doesn't waste a clients time can make thousands for just a few hours of work. A six percent commission has become a really unfair deal for a seller of a $300k + home that sells before any real marketing budget gets spent. Tyler was the answer. His commission at 1% is what it should be per company involved in any one transaction. He always answered the phone when I called and had an answer for everything I asked. Our house was sold in two weeks and I will say that the only thing that annoyed me about the entire deal was the buyer's agent getting 2.5%. Far too much for less than 10 hours of work. I sent two of my costumers to him who mentioned they wanted to sell. Both happened while mine was waiting to close and both went under contract quickly. Felix is the only way a Nashvillian should sell their home. High commissions no longer make wise business sense.",

    body: 'As a buyer, I have never had a smoother experience navigating the complex details of purchasing a home. From the agents side and the finance side the entire experience was synchronous and without any surprises. Tylerâ€™s team is impeccable and I highly recommend this organization when purchasing and selling real estate . In addition, the transaction occured without paying the outrageous fees.',
