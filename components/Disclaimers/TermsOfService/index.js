        <p>
          The FELIX Policies shall be governed by and construed in accordance
          with the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to
          principles of conflicts of laws of the State of New York or any other

        </p>
        <h2>REDUCTION IN STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</h2>

          claim or cause of action by You arising out of or related directly or
          indirectly to use of the Website and/or any services offered or sold
          by the FELIX must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or
          cause of action arose or be forever barred and therefore the statute
          of limitations is limited to one (1) year.
        </p>
        <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
        <p>
          FELIX may freely assign its rights and obligations in and to the FELIX
          Policies. You acknowledge that You may not assign, transfer or sell
          your rights or obligations under any of the FELIX Policies without

          Any purported assignment without FELIX’s consent shall be deemed null
          and void.
        </p>
        <h2>SEVERABILITY</h2>
        <p>
          One or more provisions of any of the FELIX Policies may be legally
          prohibited or otherwise unenforceable in certain jurisdictions and not
          others. In such event, the FELIX Policies shall be construed in a
          manner that is consistent with prevailing law in the jurisdiction in
          which it is enforced. Therefore, if any provision of the FELIX
          Policies is prohibited or otherwise unenforceable in a jurisdiction
          where it is being enforced, (a) it shall nevertheless be enforced to
          the fullest extent allowed by that prevailing law and (b) all other
          provisions of the FELIX Policies shall remain in full force and effect
          and shall not be invalidated or rendered unenforceable.
        </p>
        <h2>NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES</h2>
        <p>
          The FELIX Policies are not intended to be for the benefit of, and
          shall not be enforceable by any unaffiliated third party, except as
          may be specifically provided herein such as, without limitation, FELIX
          Parties and as it pertains to Your indemnification obligations as set
          forth herein. Nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
          shall confer on any third party any rights (including third-party
          beneficiary rights), remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by
          reason of any of the FELIX Policies or otherwise set forth in the
          Website, except as may be specifically provided herein. The FELIX
          Policies shall not provide third parties with any remedy, claim,
          liability, reimbursement, cause of action, or other right in excess of
          those existing without reference to the terms herein. No third party
          shall have any right, independent of any right that exists
          irrespective of the FELIX Policies, to bring any suit at law or equity
          for any matter governed by or subject to the provisions herein.
        </p>
        <h2>PROHIBITED BY LAW</h2>
        <p>
          FELIX does not represent that the Website is appropriate or available
          for use in any particular geographic location. You are Using the
          Website on Your own initiative. In the event that any aspect of the
          Website and/or the FELIX Policies are prohibited by law in Your
          jurisdiction, You agree not to Use the Website. It is solely Your
          responsibility to determine whether You are allowed by law to
          participate in the Website. Without limitation, You release FELIX from
          all liability that could arise from Your Use of the Website. Moreover,
          and without limiting the indemnification otherwise provided herein,
          You shall indemnify, defend and hold FELIX and all FELIX Parties
          harmless for any and all damages relating to a violation of this
          paragraph or any violation of the law by You.
        </p>
        <h2>FORCE MAJEURE</h2>
        <p>
          FELIX shall not be held liable for any delay or default in performing
          its obligations if such delay or default is caused by an event beyond
          its reasonable control, including without limitation, acts of nature,
          war, terror or insurrection, civil commotion, earthquake, fire, storm,
          hurricane or flood, labor disturbances, riot, epidemic or other
          similar event(s).
        </p>
        <h2>BUYERS SAVINGS PROGRAM</h2>
        <p>
          The buyer savings program offered by FELIX does not guarantee savings.
          The savings calculations displayed on the website and social media
          outlets are estimates based on the default savings rate equal to 1.5%
          of the sales price of the subject property. Actual savings may vary
          and are dependent on the purchase price, cooperating compensation
          offered to the selling broker, prevailing market conditions, and other
          factors. The estimates are not a guarantee or an offer from FELIX or
          an assigned Buying Agent/Broker to provide savings on a specific
          property. The actual savings received may be limited, prohibited, or
          reduced pursuant to the terms of service, the purchase agreement,
          lender restrictions, seller restrictions, federal Veterans
          Administration, Federal Housing Administration, and the United States
          Department of Agriculture loan programs, or other state or federal
          rules, laws, or regulations. If the transaction includes a short sale,
          additional restrictions may apply. FELIX cannot guarantee that lenders
          will allow buyers to receive 100% or a portion of the savings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The buyer savings amount is subject to a minimum amount retained by
          FELIX or the assigned Buying Agent/Broker of $4,000. Broker
          Compensation may change during the closing process due to changes in
          the terms of sale, and will be finalized only at closing. Therefore,
          neither FELIX nor the assigned Buying Agent/Broker makes any
          warranties prior to the close of escrow as to the precise amount of
          savings that the buyer may receive. The buyer savings program is
          eligible to clients who have scheduled no more than 14 in-person
          and/or virtual home tours with FELIX or an assigned Buying
          Agent/Broker. Once You have viewed more than 14 in-person and/or
          virtual home tours, FELIX at their sole discretion and without notice
          may choose to receive the full cooperating compensation being offered
          by the listing broker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless subject to any of the aforementioned limitations or otherwise
          specified by the buyer or lender, the buyer savings is applied as part
          of the purchase agreement prior to the beginning of escrow as a
          reduction in the sales price or a contribution by the seller towards
          the buyer’s closing costs. FELIX reserves the right to make changes to
          the buyer savings program and savings calculations at any time.
          Posting revisions of these Terms and Conditions to the FELIX website,
          without more, serves as notice to buyers of changes to these Terms and
          Conditions.
        </p>
        <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

          Policies shall have no force and effect. You acknowledge and agree
          that the FELIX Policies, as revised from time to time, constitute the
          entire agreement of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter
          hereof, and any prior agreements, understandings, representatives, and
          commitments concerning such subject matter, whether oral or written,
          are hereby superseded and terminated in their entirety and are of no
          further force or effect. The FELIX Policies shall be read together, in
          pari materia, to constitute one agreement.
